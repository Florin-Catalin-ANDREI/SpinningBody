# SpinningBody
Personal project. Objective: familiarization with the C# environment


This is the project story:
( Which I invite you to read, because it is quite an interesting story )

It was at the beginning of 2021 - a year and a half ago. 
A dear friend of mine came to me and told me that she is going through a difficult time at her job.
She is a good programmer, and works mainly using C++. But now she was going to write something using C#.
In the past she used C#, but since then 3 years have passed and she has forgotten a lot of things. 
She was a little upset because of this.

This situation made me think about myself, about my past.
A long, long time ago... more than 20 years ago, I was writing programs, I loved doing it, and I was pretty good at it.
But in my case, I was the right person at the wrong place and the wrong time.
Finding a job as a software developer at that time was like finding a job as a rocket scientist specializing in sending rovers to Mars.
This was a very narrow niche at that time in Romania. So over time I lost the connection with this field.

But the event with my friend made me ask myself this question:

"CAN I ...?"

...I think it was in 1996 when I used C for the last time (25 years in the past). Actually it was Borland C under MS Dos (if anyone still remembers this antiquity)
The last code I wrote was around 2006 and it was in VBA (15 years in the past). And I had no clue about C#

"CAN I DO IT?"

This project is my answer to this question

I have to admit that the most difficult part was finding and understanding the math I used here.
And I also have to apologize to the professional software developers for the mess in this code (It is still a working mess).

I am grateful for your patience to read my story.
That's why I have good news for you: It doesn't matter what your dreams are, it may be hard, but you can do it.

This is not the end of the story!
